      This is a secret page on my website especially for you. Here I
      can share videos & recordings from the most exciting projects
      I've worked on, some of which are not authorized for wide public
      dissemination. I'll update this page periodically (& let you
      know when anything particularly thrilling gets added). Click on
      the underlined text to access the various media.

      <a href="https://youtu.be/XQuvFeKCokw">Skylark — Sub Rosa</a>
      <br><br>
      Skylark is a fast-rising professional choir (with singers from
      all over the United States) that has been nominated for 3 Grammy
      awards in the last 4 years. This is a choral concert of music
      embedded with hidden meanings & secret codes! Composer Gregory
      Brown—brother of superstar novelist & occult-enthusiast Dan
      Brown (of <em>The Davinci Code</em>)—is emcee.

      <a href="https://youtu.be/N6cRF8d_Sro">Ensemble Altera — We
        Remember</a>
      <br><br>
      Ensemble Altéra (with that accent added by me to clarify
      the pronunciation) is a recently-formed professional choir
      based in Providence, Rhode Island, directed by
      internationally-acclaimed operatic countertenor Christopher
      Lowrey. This is a choral program of music about remembering and
      honoring the dead, conceived as a tribute to lives lost due to
      COVID-19.

        Advent Choir — <em>Nelson Mass</em> & more</a>
      <br><br>
      The Advent Choir is the choir of the Church of the Advent in
      Boston. On June 5th, 2022 (to celebrate the church feast of
      Pentecost) we
      performed Haydn's <em>Nelson Mass</em> with orchestra, along
      with some other choral repertoire. Check out Schuetky's
      <em>Emitte spiritum tuum</em>, a great little-known piece.

      <a href="https://youtu.be/vDfmG2vung8">Emmanuel Music — BWV 1 &
        <em>Morning Star</em></a>
      <br><br>
      Emmanuel Music is the "ensemble in residence" at Emmanuel Church
      in Boston, & is famous for presenting a different Bach cantata
      every Sunday. This is a world premiere performance of an <em>a
        cappella</em> choral work called <em>Morning Star</em> by Kati
      Agócs,
      immediately followed by Bach's beautifully lyrical cantata BWV
      1.
